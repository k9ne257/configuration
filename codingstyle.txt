My Coding Style. (primarly for java)

- never use 'extends' for classes. 'extends' is not well composable because you can only 'extend' once per class. instead use 'implements'

- when building a Framework, every class and every interface should be prefixed by the name of the Framework/Library, or an abbreviation thereof.

- interfaces always start with a capital 'I'. e.g. 'IConsumer' 

- files should not be longer than 300 lines

- only one class/interface per file

- there should be tests. if there are no tests, its a code smell.

- prefer to use 'static' subroutines when no instances are needed. not everything needs object instances.

- prefer to write package-private classes over public classes

- use dependencies whenever possible and convenient.

- performance is important

- readability is important. use javadoc.

- if a project has more than 300 files, it should be broken up into smaller, seperate projects.

- use 'final' for local variables and arguments whenever possible. it makes no sense to assign to subroutine arguments.
