General Tips to make your Setup Faster

- use linux discribution optimized for performance, like lubuntu

- use firefox "about:config" and set javascript.enabled=false
 - because the above is not practical, use NoScript Firefox extension

- use firefox "about:config" and search for "css". there are layout.css.{attribute} attributes you can toggle to disable stupid 
  font features and the like which only eat cpu and memory without purpose
  - you can make a user.js which is a profile for firefox and it will load that profile on startup
